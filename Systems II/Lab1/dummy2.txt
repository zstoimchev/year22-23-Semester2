Adjust the file offset to the next hole in the file
              greater than or equal to offset.  If offset points into
              the middle of a hole, then the file offset is set to
              offset.  If there is no hole past offset, then the file
              offset is adjusted to the end of the file (i.e., there is
              an implicit hole at the end of any file).
